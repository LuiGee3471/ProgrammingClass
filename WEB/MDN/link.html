    <h1>Baseball</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">Baseball</a> is
      <strong>a bat-and-ball game</strong>
      played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The
      game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher">pitcher</a>,
      throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.</p>

      <p></p>The objectives of the offensive team (batting team) are to hit the ball
      into the field of play, and to run the basesâ€”having its runners advance
      counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The
      objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from
      becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.</p> 
      
      <p>A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and
      touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The
      team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.</p>
